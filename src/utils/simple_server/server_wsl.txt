If server doesn't work when running in WSL then try to connect to it using localhost:PORT
4 different access levels:
    1- localhost
    2- wsl ip
    3- computer ip
    4- external ip
2-4 seem to not work.
------ TO FIX:
in powershell:
Step 1: find ip of wsl
    RUN: wsl hostname -I
Step 2: route port to IP from previous step
    RUN: netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3242 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3242 connectaddress=192.168.112.243
this could also potentially brake the port you run it on (localhost will no longer work)
running the same command again will overwrite

To show NETSH active routings:  netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4
